# SheetMind: AI-Powered Conversational Data Analysis

SheetMind transforms the way you interact with structured data. Instead of wrestling with complex formulas or code, simply ask questions in natural language and get instant insights, explanations, and the underlying analysis code.

## The Problem We Solve

Analyzing data locked in spreadsheets (CSVs, Excel files) or other structured formats can be a significant hurdle. Many individuals and teams lack the specialized skills (like advanced Excel, SQL, or Python programming) or the time to perform in-depth data exploration. This often leads to:
-   Underutilized data and missed opportunities.
-   Time-consuming manual analysis prone to errors.
-   Reliance on data specialists, creating bottlenecks.
-   A desire for quick answers without a steep learning curve.

SheetMind aims to break down these barriers, making data analysis accessible, intuitive, and efficient for everyone.

## Our Solution: SheetMind

SheetMind is an intelligent application that allows you to:
-   **Upload your data files** (CSV, Excel, Parquet).
-   **Ask questions in plain English** (e.g., "What are the average sales per product category?", "Show me customer growth trends.").
-   **Receive comprehensive results**:
    -   A direct textual answer.
    -   A clear explanation of how the answer was derived.
    -   The Python code generated and executed for the analysis.
    -   A preview of the resulting data (if applicable).

It's designed to feel like you're conversing with a data analyst who not only gives you answers but also shows you their work.

## Key Features

-   **Natural Language Queries:** No need to learn complex query languages.
-   **Multi-Format Support:** Handles CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), and Parquet files.
-   **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Leverages Google's Gemini LLM to generate Python (pandas) code dynamically.
-   **Transparent Analysis:** See the exact code used, promoting trust and learning.
-   **Step-by-Step Explanations:** Understand the "how" behind the "what."
-   **Safe Code Execution:** AI-generated code runs in an isolated sandbox environment.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web experience.
-   **Extensible Agentic Architecture:** Built with a modular system of AI agents.

## How it Works (High-Level Architecture)

SheetMind employs an agent-based system:
1.  **Streamlit UI:** Provides the interface for file upload and query input.
2.  **ControllerAgent:** Orchestrates the workflow, manages requests, and interacts with other agents.
3.  **DataAnalysisAgent:**
    -   Loads the data.
    -   Communicates with the Gemini LLM (`GeminiClient`) to understand the query and generate appropriate Python code.
    -   Executes the generated code safely in an `IsolatedPythonExecutor`.
    -   Uses the LLM again to generate explanations of the results and code.
4.  **Results Display:** The UI presents the findings from the agents.

## Current Implementation: Streamlit Application

The primary way to interact with SheetMind is through its Streamlit web application.

### Setup and Running

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.8+
    *   Pip (Python package installer)

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the `SheetMinds` directory (where `requirements.txt` and `streamlit_app.py` are located) and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Google API Key**:
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the `SheetMinds` directory (the same directory as `streamlit_app.py`).
    *   Add your Google API key to this file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Gemini API key.

5.  **Run the Streamlit Application**:
    In your terminal, from the `SheetMinds` directory, run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
    This will start the Streamlit server, and the application should open in your web browser.

### How to Use the Streamlit App

1.  **Upload Data**: Click on "Choose a data file" to upload your CSV, Excel, or Parquet file.
2.  **Enter Query**: Type your data analysis question in the text area (e.g., "What are the average sales per product category?").
3.  **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Data" button.
4.  **View Results**: The application will display:
    *   A textual answer to your query.
    *   An explanation of how the answer was derived.
    *   The Python code generated and executed for the analysis.
    *   A preview of the resulting data (if applicable).
